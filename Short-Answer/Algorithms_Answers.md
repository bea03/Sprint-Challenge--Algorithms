 a) This is a O(n) because the while loop will only run a fixed amount (n) of times.


 b) O(log n) each time the nested loop runs, j doubles while n increases  


c)O(n) bunnies is decreased to base case with one step.

## Exercise II
Use a bineary search to test the floors by halves. this is a O(n)
